        Orléans is the capital of the Centre-Val de Loire region. It is located on the banks of the Loire River in north-central France. Joan of Arc delivered the city from the siege of the English in 1429, an event celebrated with an annual festival.

        During the Capetian era, Orléans was the capital of a county and then of a duchy held as an appanage by the house of Valois-Orléans. It was in the cathedral of Orléans, stronghold of the Capetian family, that the double coronation of Hugues Capet and his son Robert II the Pious (born and baptized in Orléans27) took place, the cornerstone of a power of eight centuries. For this reason, the county (then from the 14th century the duchy) of Orléans was traditionally given as an appanage to the king's youngest son.

         In 1108, Louis VI the Fat was crowned in Orléans Cathedral by the Archbishop of Sens. This is one of the rare Capetian coronations that did not take place in Reims. He prevented the creation of municipal institutions in 113828.

            In 1306, the University of Orléans, the fourth in France after Paris, Toulouse and Montpellier, was founded by Pope Clement V. Attracting intellectuals from all over Europe, it specialized in law. It contributes to the prestige of the city.

            The title of Duke of Orléans was created in 1306 by the King of France. The Dukes of Orléans, whose duchy was founded in the 14th century, almost never came to their city. Orléans is then the capital of this royal province. As brothers or cousins ​​of the king, they were part of his Court and had little opportunity to leave it. Officially their castle was that of Blois. The Duchy of Orléans was the largest of all. It started in Arpajon, continued to Chartres, Vendôme, Blois, Vierzon, Montargis. The duke's son bore the title of Duke of Chartres. Inheritances from great families and marriages allowed dukes to accumulate colossal wealth. Orléans is also the city of Joan of Arc. During the Hundred Years' War, this young woman played a very important role in Orléans. In 1428, the English besieged the city. On the south bank, a gate called “des Tourelles” protected access to the bridge. The lifting of the siege of the city in 1429 by Joan of Arc marks the beginning of the reconquest of the territories occupied by the English. The city, which had been besieged in vain for months by the English, was liberated on May 8, 1429, with the help of the great generals of the kingdom, Dunois and Florent d'Illiers. The inhabitants therefore devoted him an admiration and loyalty which still lasts today (Johannic festivals of Orléans). They named her “the virgin of Orléans” and offered her a bourgeois house in the city. The inhabitants also contributed to the ransom to free her when she was taken prisoner, in vain, because Charles VII, the dauphin who became king thanks to her, kept the money for himself. The city also financed a commemorative monument established on the Loire bridge at the end of the 15th century. The monument, destroyed in 1562 by the Huguenots, then rebuilt, was destroyed again in 1792.

            Once the Hundred Years' War ended, the city regained its prosperity. The strategic location of its bridge allowed it to collect rights of way. The city attracted traders from everywhere.
